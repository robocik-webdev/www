# KN Robocik Website

**Note:** This is now a legacy version. As the crew members change, the website evolves...

Our website for marketing purposes and online presence.\
The main idea behind the design was an illusion of going deeper underwater with every scroll. Clean and pastel colored.

Made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Uses [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for some content management.
